# -Number-Guessing-
This project is a fun game that generates a random number in a certain specified range and the user must guess the number after receiving hints. Every time a user’s guess is wrong they are prompted with more hints to make it easier — at the cost of reducing the score.

The program also requires functions to check if an actual number is entered by the user, and finds the difference between the two numbers.
